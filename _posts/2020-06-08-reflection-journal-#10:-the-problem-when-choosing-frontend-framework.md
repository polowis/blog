When I start a new web application project, there are two big things I need to consider. A backend framework and a frontend framework. Choosing the right one will improve the web's performance a lot. 

It's always a hot topic when talking about frontend technologies,. There are many popular frontend framework such as **React** or **Angular**, these frameworks are used in lots of modern web applications. Beside **React** and **Angular**, there are lots of new framework being released every year. 

Even if you don't use **React** or **Angular**, you stil know it. But to make it easier to work with Flask, I decided to use **Vue**. 

At this point, **Vue** may sounds a lot strange to you. I didn't know its existence until I started working with **Laravel**. I was wondering why **Laravel** didn't choose to use **React** or **Angular** but instead using **Vue**. 

I thought I would struggle with using a new frontend framework but as it turned out, **Vue** is really easy to use. You don't even need to know about **JSX** or **ES2015**, just a little knowledge about JavaScript and HTML. With Vue, I can manipulate the DOM using Virtual DOM a lot easier rather than using Jquery or Vanilla JavaScript. Everytime you change the varible **X**, the **X * 2** operation will also change accordingly. It has state management can be used from simple to complex applications. And it's in real time!

## Who is behind Vue?

When talking about **Angular**, the first thing come to your mind must be **Google**, **React** is created by **Facebook**. But no one heard of **Vue** before, so many people might think that it may not last long. The person created **Vue** is Evan You and I believe that he will make Vue shine. He used to worked at **Meteor** (JavaScript web framework) and **Google**. And there are lots of people in the community also support Vue by making contributions. Hopefully in the next 2, 3 years, when taking about Vue, people won't go *What is that??*

## Flask and Vue

So when I used Flask together with Vue, I realized that I can work on the frontend really easy, instead of using AJAX, I can just use axios with vue and it still does the same thing but with painless way of writing. In this way I can get a frontend code up and run in just a few seconds. 

## Why not Angular?

Hmm, Angular is great but the problem is it uses typescript (it gets slower because you have to compile it to JavaScript) and is a lot complicated to use when compare to React or Vue. 

## Why not React?
React uses JSX and JSX is a lot harder to understand. While Vue uses normal HTML and JS.
