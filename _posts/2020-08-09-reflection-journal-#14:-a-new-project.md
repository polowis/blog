## Ideas

Recently, there are many start-up businesses, some of them are about selling things. For example, in Vietnam, the majority of people job involved selling products that are bought from other sources. The issue is that some sources are unknown or not reliable which resulting in tons of people got arrested due to selling unknown sources product. This is not their fault, they just have a little to almost no knowledge where to get that product to sell. The idea of this application is to provide a trusted source, acts like a middle man where all reliable sources are verified so that people who want to sell the products can buy directly from this website. 

## The system

This is basically just like eCommerce website but with a slightly different way of working. Because this is designed for small and big businesses to integrate, some products need to be purchased in a large amount. The idea is to have a system that accepts crytocurrency so that we can buy or sell them directly. I also want to implement a new digital currency and act as a payment method for the service. The website will use Flask and based off the Pandoru framework in order to boost the productivity of the project. I also came up with an idea that is to have recommendation system just like other websites. Some of the other methods so earn digital coin will be through my JavaScript game **The Light of Midnight**

## The design

I decided to use Vue as frontend framework just like my other websites. The design looks pretty much like an eCommerce website but with slightly different styles. It took me about 3 days to finish working on the design. And now I'm moving the html file to Vue so that the development will be a lot easier as I can separate them into multiple components that serve for many purposes.
